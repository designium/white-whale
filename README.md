White Whale
========================

White Whale is a basic Rails 3.2 app using all the latest UI (Twitter Bootstrap) and UX (a long list of gems - read the Gemfile) as a reference and best practices. You can fork or use it in your own project.

I'm currently using the following gems:

- gem 'bcrypt-ruby', '~> 3.0.0'
- gem 'capistrano'
- gem "geocoder", "~> 1.1.1"
- gem "carrierwave", "~> 0.6.2"
- gem "rabl", "~> 0.6.10"
- gem "bootstrap-sass", "~> 2.0.2"
- gem "client_side_validations", "~> 3.1.4"
- gem "simple_form", "~> 2.0.1"
- gem "omniauth", "~> 1.1.0"
- gem "split", "~> 0.4.1"
- gem "best_in_place", "~> 1.0.6"
- gem "paper_trail", "~> 2.6.3"
- gem "delayed_job", "~> 3.0.2"
- gem "prawn", "~> 0.12.0"
- gem "copycopter_client", "~> 2.0.1"
- gem "will_paginate", "~> 3.0.3"

How can I use it?
============================

WW has a basic scaffold called post that is already Restful and it shows the use of all the gems.


There are two ways to use White Whale.

You can clone the whole project into your computer:

    `git clone git://github.com/designium/white-whale.git`
    
Or you can just check the code here.


Future
=========================

With the White Whale done, I want to create a gem that is a generator for all the best practices from WW.

I think this will take more time.
